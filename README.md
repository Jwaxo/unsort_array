## What It Does

unsort_array is a pair of functions that work together to return a randomized version of an array that keeps the key associations, if there are any, while mixing up non-key elements throughout. It was basically created because I couldn't find a function that did it, because I could think of at least one situation where I would want this function, and because it's a really dumb name for something and I like things existing that have dumb names.

It does not randomize! It unsorts.
